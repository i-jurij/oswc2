## CSS 
For admins panel app use CSS framework [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).   
For other pages app use [oswc2_styles](https://github.com/i-jurij/oswc2_styles) - collected from [BassCSS](https://basscss.com/) and [Picnic](https://picnicss.com/) using [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) and [rollup-plugin-css-porter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-css-porter).

BassCSS using for functionality (typo, margin, padding, display ... ).   
Picnic using for components (buttons, forms, cards, blocks ...).  

## Webpack
    `npm run dev` - mode development (rereads js and css on the fly, address is host_ip:3000/assets),   
    `npm run build` - mode production for prepare js and css into www/assets.   

Entry is `resources/js/app.js` and `resources/css/style.css`, all other js files and css files can be imported into them.  

## Work
### Start
First run console command into project folder:  
```php ./bin/start.php migrate```  
for created db tables "users", "roles", "permissions", "roles_permissions" and "pages". 
It safely for data in existing tables.  
SQL query for tables created is in file "create_sql.php".   

Then run:  
```php ./bin/start.php useradd <username> <password>```  
for user with admin grants creating.  
Password minimal length = 7 (it can be change in app/Model/UserFacade.php).  

***After user with specific permissions adding you must first permissions added***   
Other users can be added from the admin panel.  
Before user creating you can create permissions (resource, action) then roles. 
Permissions can be added automatically from classes names of models directory and their methods (you can change it from presenters and theirs methods) or manually.  
If you set in permissions only resource without action - you allow all actions of the resource. 

***If you change columns of table "users" in file "create_sql.php" change it in "app/Model/UsersTableColumns.php" too***

***Users factory can be run from "bin/factorys/user"***  

### Config   
Configs files are located in "app/config". Read this [documentation](https://doc.nette.org/en/configuring).   
Config `pages_sqlite` is require for page menu on main page and admin pages.  

### Routing
"app/Core/RouterFactory.php", [documentation](https://doc.nette.org/en/application/routing)  
Application use three main routes: "Home", "Sign" and "Admin".   
Other routes as in Nette Framework: "Home::Pages::OtherPresenters::method", "Admin::Pages::OtherPresenters::method".   

### Models
`PagesFacade` - get data from table pages (for menu at main page).  
`MyAuthenticator` - get user data (name, roles and other)   
`PermissionFacade` - add, edit, delete permissions   
`UserFacade` - add, edit, delete users   

### Accessory  
`RequireLoggedUser` - trait for page that need autentication (in user not logged - redirect to sign in)  

### Admin page and menu creating
#### Nav menu
For admins basic pages: "Users", "Roles", "Permissions", "Logs", "Cache".  
It is created manually.   

#### Sidebar menu
Menu section CMS is created automatically from filesystem.   
The file structure is as follows eg: 
``` 
CMS dir  
	First dir
	FirstPresenter.php (namespace "App\UI\Cms\First" and class "FirstPresenter")  
			Second dir   
			SecondPresenter.php (namespace "App\UI\Cms\Second" and class "SecondPresenter")  
					Third dir  
					ThirdPresenter.php (namespace "App\UI\Cms\Third" and class "ThirdPresenter")  
```
Menu point will be viewed only if Presenters class existed.				
That is, only controllers classes are used and if you not need the menu point - create method into presenter. And if you need menu links - create dirs and into it create presenters class for action.  
Permissions for user is ["Cms", "menu"].
